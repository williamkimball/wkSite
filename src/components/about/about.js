            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Curiosity has always been my defining character trait, and ever
              since I was a child I have voraciously consumed new information.
              My inquisitiveness led me to pursue education in anthropology as I
              sought to understand humanity more deeply. After finishing my
              undergraduate education, I sought a career path that would
              allow me to be in a constant state of growth. I was
              introduced to software development by a family friend, but until that
              point, I had always considered programming to be a skill you
              needed to begin at a young age to be truly good at. I never
              really pursued programming apart from writing "Hello, world" in about a
              dozen different languages. However, once I truly dug in and
              started to learn, I was absolutely hooked. I spent 12 hours a day
              for the next two months learning to program, and made the decision
              that software development was a career that would be more than
              just a job for me when I enrolled in Nashville Software School's
              six month Full Stack development bootcamp. Four months later, I am often
              stunned when I reflect on how my life has changed, and I am
              incredibly excited to be pursuing a career that has no room for
              intellectual stagnation, and will constantly push me to learn new
              skills.
